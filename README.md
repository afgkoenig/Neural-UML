With this code you can use the neural network create to detect element in a class diagram.

Just run the code "test_images.py" and you obtain a visualisation of the result in a folder "./output/image/". You also have the associate csv.

You can test on your own image, you have just to put her in the folder "./input/original_image/" with name "test*"

If you have an error with the utilisation of YOLO try to use the command "pip install --upgrade ultralytics"

In the folder "DatasetA" you have all annotations from Lindholmen Dataset.

In the folder "DatasetB" you have all annotation from the paper "Multiclass classification of four types of uml diagrams from images using deep learning".

You also have the link of all images come from Lindholmen Dataset and declare to be a class diagram in "dataset_without_annotation.csv"
