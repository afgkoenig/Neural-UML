With this code you can use the neural network create to detect element in a class diagram.

Just run the code and you obtain a visualisation of the result in a folder "./output/image/". You also have the associate csv.

You can test on your own image, you have just to put her in the folder "./input/original_image/" with name "test*"

If you have an error with the utilisation of YOLO try to use the command "pip install --upgrade ultralytics"
